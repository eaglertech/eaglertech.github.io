<p style="font-family: Arial;">Hello. kingofnetflix here, bringing you sad news.<br /><br />This message is seperated into different parts. For your convience, I have made a Chapter Selection for you :)<br /><br />Whew, what a ride.<br /><br />After 600+ total registered players (exluding alts), $212 spent in total, a whopping 60 players online at once, and an unexpected server (without the server dying), this rollercoster of a ride has been amazing to go through, even with all the troubles with bots, server crashes, Roxy_Poxy04's fan cult, all the racism, bans, and littleboy123 drama.<br /><br />This Eaglercraft server has been amazing to go through, even if it costed me money and time and sweat (sometimes tears) to go through and make, seeing people happy is what mattered to me. Seeing people enjoy playing on my server, making new friends, and just having fun really made my day, and none of this would have been possible without you guys.<br /><br />Now, onto your data.<br /><br />The data I have on you is very very limited, I do not log IP's (unless I use it to ban you, so far no one), and I only keep data such as your chat infractions, etc. If you would like to see that data or request imminent deletion, please contant me on Discord, my user is: kingofnetflix<br /><br /><br />How am I going to access my builds? Will the world be lost?<br /><br />To answer your question, no, both worlds (pre-reset and post-reset) are intact. And luckily for you, I will be providing those worlds to you.<br /><br />To access my super amazing and user friendly UI I made for you in this case, you may visit the website below:<br /><a href="https://eaglertech.org" style="font-family: Arial;">eaglertech.org</a><br /><br />If the link below is blocked, you may use the following direct links:<br /><br />Pre-reset world (the shop existed in this world):<br /><br />Post-reset world (the shop didnt exist here):<br /><br />To recover your items, you must go to your base's cords wherever it was, or log in with the EXACT SAME username on Minecraft then load up the world. Use a cracked account on Minecraft, or load it up on Eaglercraft singleplayer, I don't care. I will not be providing any support, you figure it out on your own :&gt;<br /><br />The final strech.<br /><br />Thank you everyone, for this amazing journey. It's been amazing seeing all of you enjoy playing on my server, grinding what could have been class time into the server, and just spending time overall. The money I have spent on this game was totally worth it, and I would do it again. Unfortunetly, it has packed a serious punch in my wallet, so it must go for now. Also all the stress was killin' me.</p>
